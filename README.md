These are the project I have made so far.

 + TresEnRaya is a simulation of a Tic Tac Toe gameplay. I have first made in with procedural programming in Java and then converted it to OOP.
   It was a class project and we were required to apply our own solutions and ideas to complete it.

+ Pancho's Coffee is a project where I utilised skills I have learned so far in HTML,CSS and Javascript to make a webpage of a company that produces and sells coffee blends.
  It has 3 pages, a form with functionalities implemented with JS and some effects created with CSS. Project is uploaded as a zip file.
